00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,714
Old Roblox was SO much better and I'm tired of pretending it's not.

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:05,180
Like, we had GUESTS.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,682
Those yellow dudes just hanging out in every game.

4
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,312
Roblox deleted them for "being confusing." Bruh what?

5
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,205
And remember TIX?

6
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:11,392
Free currency just for logging in?

7
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:12,529
You could earn Robux without paying.

8
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:12,788
Now?

9
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:13,614
Everything costs money.
