00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,269
Okay so Roblox just invented the most life-changing digital economy ever.

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,379
Its literally gambling for kids.

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:09,348
Limiteds are rare items you can resell for Robux, sounds innocent, like digital trading cards.

4
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:10,899
But then you look at the actual system.

5
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:12,890
Items randomly go limited with zero warning.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,658
Kids refresh the catalog at 3 AM hoping to flip a digital hat.

7
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:18,431
Theres price volatility, market manipulation, FOMO tactics.

8
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:20,833
Like I dont know what Roblox was thinking calling this collecting.

9
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,540
Some items cost thousands of real dollars.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,783
The rarest one, the Dominus Empyreus, worth over 300000, for a hat that doesnt exist.

11
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:32,119
And whos trading these, children, with no regulations, no age restrictions.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,340
Roblox really said financial literacy and meant teach kids stock market gambling.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,288
Your 10-year-old now understands pump and dump schemes better than Wall Street.

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,353
Humanity has been saved.
