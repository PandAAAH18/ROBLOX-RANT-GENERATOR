00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
Old Roblox was SO much better and I'm tired of pretending it's not.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,016
Like, we had GUESTS.

3
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:06,820
Those yellow dudes just hanging out in every game.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,852
Roblox deleted them for "being confusing." Bruh what?

5
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:10,918
And remember TIX?

6
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:12,341
Free currency just for logging in?

7
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,704
You could earn Robux without paying.

8
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:14,017
Now?

9
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:15,009
Everything costs money.
